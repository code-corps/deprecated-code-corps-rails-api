## How do I install the Code Corps API?

### Requirements

You will need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).

Here are some direct links if you're on [Mac OS X](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) or [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/).

Follow those download instructions. Once you can run the `docker` command, you can safely move on.

### Clone this repository

You'll want to [clone this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) with `git clone https://github.com/code-corps/code-corps-api.git`.

The directory structure will look like the following:

```shell
code-corps-api/          # → Root folder for this project
├── app/
├── bin/
├── ...                  # → More standard Rails files
├── docker-compose.yml   # → Compose file for configuring Docker containers
└── Dockerfile           # → Creates base Ruby Docker container
```

### Setup your Docker containers and run the server

> Note: We bind to ports 80 for `web`, 8081 for `apiary`, 6380 for `redis` and 5001 for `foreman`. Make sure you're not running anything on those ports. We do not expose port 5432 for `postgres` or 9200 for `elasticsearch`.

Go to the `code-corps-api` directory and type:

```shell
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

You should now see a lot of output from the Docker processes and will not be able to interact with that terminal window.

Docker will set up your base Ruby container, as well as containers for:

- `postgres`
- `elasticsearch`
- `redis`
- `web` runs `foreman s` with the `Procfile.dev`
- `test` runs `guard start`
- `apiary` runs an [Apiary client](API.md#apiary-cli) server on port `8081`

You can view more detailed information about these services in the `docker-compose.yml` file, but you shouldn't need to edit it unless you're intentionally contributing changes to our Docker workflow.

### Setup your database

You can now create and seed your database in the `web` container with our helpful bash script.

Open up a new terminal window and type:

```shell
bin/setup
```

At its heart, this script is running:

```shell
docker-compose run web rake db:create db:migrate db:test:prepare db:seed_fu
```

Point your browser (or make a direct request) to `http://api.lvh.me/ping`. There should be a `{"ping":"pong"}` response from it. If you hit the index route instead, you'll probably get `INDEX NOT FOUND` since it's not serving up our Ember app yet.

`lvh.me` resolves to `localhost` so you can use subdomains, like our `api` subdomain.

### Next steps

Now that you're set up, you should [read more about how to develop with the API](USAGE.md).

### Issues installing?

Having trouble?

Create an issue in this repo and we'll look into it.

Docker's a bit new for us, so there may be some hiccups at first. But hopefully this makes for a less painful developer environment for you in the long run.
